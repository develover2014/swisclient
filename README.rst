SwisClient
==========

SwisClient is a Python class that allows the end user to interact with the SolarWinds API (SWIS). The base of this code is used from the SolarWinds Orion SDK sample (https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK), with only the class implemented so that developers can further extend it.

-------
SwisClient should work with both Python2 and Python3

Python2 Install from pip::

    pip install swisclient

Python3 Install from pip3::

    pip3 install swisclient

Or you can run build this locally::

    git clone https://github.com/nlgotz/swisclient.git
    python setup.py install



How to Use
----------

Example::

    import swisclient

    # Create connection to SolarWinds Orion Server
    swis = swisclient.SwisClient("server", "username", "password")

    # Add current node to NCM
    try:
        ncm = swis.invoke("Cirrus.Nodes", "AddNodetoNCM", 1)
